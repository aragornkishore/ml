This is an assorted collection of machine learning code I've written
in Python/numpy.

The bulk of it is code for training restricted Boltzmann machines
(RBM) but there's also some DBN code and a few other bits.

I don't expect this to be particularly useful to anyone but me. It's
not optimized for performance though, so you might find some of it
quite readable.

If you want to take a closer look the best place to start is the 'ex'
directory.

You'll find my email on my GitHub profile if you want to get in touch.
