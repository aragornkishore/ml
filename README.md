This is an assorted collection of machine learning code I've written
in Python/numpy. The bulk of it is code for training restricted
Boltzmann machines (RBM). It includes examples of [training a GRBM on
image
patches](https://github.com/phorsfall/ml/blob/master/ex/grbm/color_patches.py)
and [stacking RBMs to form a deep belief
net](https://github.com/phorsfall/ml/tree/master/ex/dbn) (DBN).

I don't expect this to be particularly useful to anyone but me,
although it's not optimized for performance so you might find some of
it quite readable.

You'll find my email on my GitHub profile if you want to get in touch.
